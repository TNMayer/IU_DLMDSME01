    "# Modeling\n",
    "This is the point at which your hard work begins to pay off. The data you spent time preparing are brought into the analysis tools in IBM SPSS Modeler, and the results begin to shed some light on the business problem posed during Business Understanding. Modeling is usually conducted in multiple iterations. Typically, data miners run several models using the default parameters and then fine-tune the parameters or revert to the data preparation phase for manipulations required by their model of choice. It is rare for an organization's data mining question to be answered satisfactorily with a single model and a single execution. This is what makes data mining so interesting--there are many ways to look at a given problem, and IBM SPSS Modeler offers a wide variety of tools to help you do so."

    "## Selecting Modeling Technique\n",
    "Although you may already have some idea about which types of modeling are most appropriate for your organization's needs, now is the time to make some firm decisions about which ones to use. Determining the most appropriate model will typically be based on the following considerations: \n",
    "* The data types available for mining. For example, are the fields of interest categorical (symbolic)? \n",
    "* Your data mining goals. Do you simply want to gain insight into transactional data stores and unearth interesting purchase patterns? Or do you need to produce a score indicating, for example, propensity to default on a student loan? \n",
    "* Specific modeling requirements. Does the model require a particular data size or type? Do you need a model with easily presentable results? \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Modeling Techniques \n",
    "\n",
    "Many modeling techniques are available in IBM SPSS Modeler. Frequently, data miners use more than one to approach the problem from a number of directions. Task List When deciding on which model(s) to use, consider whether the following issues have an impact on your choices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does the model require the data to be split into test and training sets? â€¢ Do you have enough data to produce reliable results for a given model? \n",
    "* Does the model require a certain level of data quality? Can you meet this level with the current data? \n",

    "\n",
    "### Modeling Assumptions \n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin to narrow down your modeling tools of choice, take notes on the decision-making process. Document any data assumptions as well as any data manipulations made to meet the model's requirements. For example, both the Logistic Regression and Neural Net nodes require the data types to be fully instantiated (data types are known) before execution. This means you will need to add a Type node to the stream and execute it to run the data through before building and running a model. Similarly, predictive models, such as C5.0, may benefit from rebalancing the data when predicting rules for rare events. When making this type of prediction, you can often get better results by inserting a Balance node into the stream and feeding the more balanced subset into the model. Be sure to document these types of decisions."

Most data miners typically build several models and compare the results before deploying or integrating them. \n",

Typically, most people build a model first using the default options and then refine parameters during subsequent sessions. \n",
    "\n",

    "In IBM SPSS Modeler, running models is a straightforward task. Once you've inserted the model node into the stream and edited any parameters, simply execute the model to produce viewable results. Results appear in the Generated Models navigator on the right side of the workspace. You can right-click a model to browse the results.

You should also consider whether the results make logical sense or whether they are too simplistic for your business goals (for example, a sequence that reveals purchases such as wine > wine > wine). \n",
