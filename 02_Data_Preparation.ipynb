If two transactions are within one minute, with the same amount of money and from the same country, it is (for a decent number of tries) safe to assume that they are payment attempts of the same purchase.

We have binary variables and continuous variables in the dataset. For the correlation of two continuous variables the correlation is calculated based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, for two binary variables it is the Phi-coefficient and for a binary and a continuous variable it is the point biseral correlation. The Phi-coefficient and the point biseral correlation are both special cases of the Pearson correlation. Hence, for all feature constellations in the dataset we can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient in order to remove redundant features.

    "The success rate which is the most relevant optimization criterion hasn´t been explored yet to generate features for the machine learning model. It is not possible to just calculate the overall success rate for different attributes (e.g. PSP) because this would imply data leakage. Those features have to be calculated in a rolling window approach based on previous transactions. In order to not throw away data missing values will be imputed if there is no data based on the most probable success overall or for a given PSP. The overall success rate is 0.37. The success rate for Goldcard is 0.62, for UK Card 0.4, for Moneycard 0.37 and for Simplecard 0.26. So the missing data imputation which is only relevant for observations at the very beginning of the dataset is the imputation of 0 by default and 1 for the PSP Goldcard. But this case should be limited to just a few observations. In order to apply this rolling success rate calculation the dataset has to be ordered based on the timestamp which we already did."

(2021) described a greedy approach to find the best suited timeintervals with a wide range of t´s, the t´s for this case-study will be limited to [300, 600, 3600] seconds.

    "Treebased models are particularly useful in dealing with categorical features and finding insightful breakpoints in continuous variables. From a modeling perspective it seems reasonable to achieve good modeling results with treebased models. Furthermore the dataset is not very large and contains only structured data. From a performance perspective ```XGBoost``` models have proven to be particularly competitive in Kaggle competitions for the aforementioned data settings. Because ```XGBoost``` models are harder to tune and tend to overfit also ```Random Forest``` models will be considered in a first modeling iteration. So ```Random Forest``` will be the starting point when it comes to the feature selection phase. In order to do so, the data has to be formatted in such a way, that an ```XGBoost``` implementation in Python can deal with the dataset. This means all categorical and ordinal features in the dataset have to be enconded to numerical features. This can be achieved by One-Hot or Label-Encoding.\n",
